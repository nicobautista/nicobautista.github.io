        "Starting with a low end 3D printer, the tool-head assembly was improved with a new design to hold an E3D V6 hot-end, silent 40mm Noctua fans for both hot-end and part cooling, and also a mounting point for a sensor for bed leveling. Additionally, the mainboard was upgraded from an old MKS Robin to an STM32-based board, and the stepper drivers were also upgraded from the basic A4988 to Trinamic silent serial stepper drivers. Originally, the printer had a very early version the Marlin Firmware. This was upgraded to Marlin 2.0 with the new board. Later on, a Raspberry Pi was added to support running Klipper.",
